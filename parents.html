                   <div>How they get married? It was because my father fall in love with my mother on a first sight. They both from different school. My father went to Vocational College meanwhile my mother went to a famous highschool. Despite my mother keep being mad at my father and told him to go away. My father was so stubborn and bold. So he decide to propose my mother and my mother accept it since she's  tired of making my father go away.</div>
               <p>
                   <div>As you can see, I don't have much family photos that available with me because my family don't usually like taking picture and we are also not the type who keep it as a digital one. This photo is from Raya in 2023 if I'm not wrong.</div>
