        <div> This is my new classmate! After pursuing myself getting a degree. It was one of the biggest decision I ever made. I had to move far away from my family for the first time!. I was scared and excited. It was one of my biggest dream when I was a kid to leave my family to pursue my education on this level. My first time meeting my classmate, it was hard to remember their names. I usually take quite long time to remember people name. </div>
    <p>
        <div> I have around around 62 people in my class, then it was devided to 2 groups. Group A and group B. Each of group has 31 people. I am in group B. Group B or we call it class B is quite friendly in my opinion. Maybe it is because I spend most my time learning with group B. Being a UiTM student was not that bad. I can see the life of university student through my own eyes.</div>
