        <div>This is my eldest brother and his little family. His name is Amir Bin Shaifuddin. He is 31 years old this year. I call him Sulung. It might be weird when people heard us calling him that but I wasn't the one who starts to call him as a Sulung. Despite being the oldest siblings. He easily waste his money even now. He also likes to buy modified parts of car and motorcyles. </div>

His wife name Nur Aini. She is a full time house wife for my brother. She used to work as an accountant but had to resign to follow my brother move to Kuala Lumpur.</div>

        <div>My sister is working as an accountant, she also just graduate from UiTM. I follow her footsteps a lot including to pursue my studies to this level. Among other siblings only my sister really wants to continue study. After that I also do the same thing my sister did.</div>

        <div>Of course I couldn't help but putting my pet as my siblings. Let me introduce him again. This is Ren. A bengal cat but not entire pure bengal breed. I've got him after one of my father's friend gave to my father. Actually during that time I was traumatized to have another pet again due to the reason that I have lost Gary. Gary is also my cat. One day he go out and not coming back. I was so sad during that time. I cried a lot. So when receiving Ren. He look almost identical with Gary. It just the different is the pattern of their fur. Gary have thick fur and greyish colour. </div>
