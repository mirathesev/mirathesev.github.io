        <p>
            <div> Usually my life quotes can come from a books. Since I read lot of book in many kind of genre. Some words can motivate me. </div>
        <p>
            <div> The first quotes that I really hold dear to my life is. "He who climbs the ladder, must begin at the bottom". This quote taken from Haikyuu, a japanese manga. The manga or known as comic is a story about volleyball. Haikyuu means volleyball. The reason why I like this, it motivates me as a nobody, I will have a chance one day to be a someone that I used to admire, if I don't give up now.</div>
        <p>
            <div> I have been reading this comic through my entire teenager. I start at the age of 14 years old when I was exposed to this Haikyuu. Actually I know Haikyuu by watching the animation. The story was fun. It focus on the main character where he who likes volleyball but have no experience in it. So he start from the bottom, learning and meeting with a volleyball club. That when his journey start. The comic completed in 2020, after 8 yeaars. During that time I was one of the candidate for SPM. </div>
        <p>
            <div> Being one of the fan of this masterpiece change my point of view. It became my comfort books and animation series for me. If I have hard time I would re-watch the animation just to make me motivate.</div>
        </p>

        <p>
             <div> Another quote that I likes is "Truly, the harder you climb, the harder you fall". This is a quote from a chinese novel but I couldn't recall what was the title. The reason why I'm liking this is because from the quote itself you can see if you ever trying to be better by climbing up the stair to the succesful life, they will be a chance one day you might slip down while walking and it will be very painful.</div>
        <p>
            <div> When you try to be better it can be hard for you, it makes you restless, burned out and much more. This will be easy to make you crumpled over yourself. So that's why you need to bounce back. The ability to stand up for yourself even if it's mean by starting over. So this quote is a reminder for me if I ever feeling restless but still ongoing with my journey. </div>
